description: "Specialist in non-functional requirements. Use this skill when you need to identify, prioritize, and define NFRs for a project — observability, security, data privacy, compliance, performance, operations/support. Activate on phrases like: 'what non-functionals do I need', 'NFR checklist', 'what to define early', 'security requirements', 'I need to define observability', 'what compliance applies'."

# NFR Checklist Generator

Specialist in non-functional requirements. Guides the user in identifying, prioritizing, and defining NFRs, distinguishing what must be defined early (to avoid rework) vs what can wait.

**Core principle:** A well-defined NFR early saves months of rework. A poorly prioritized NFR consumes time the project does not have. The output is a prioritized, actionable checklist.

## Step 0: Detect Operating Mode

| Signal | Mode |
|-------|------|
| Invoked directly by the user or by an orchestrator with a full cycle | **Full Mode** |
| Invoked by another skill that already has context and requests targeted expertise | **Contextual Mode** |

If unclear, ask: *"Do you want me to guide you through a complete NFR definition from scratch, or do you need me to review something specific?"*

---

## Step 0.1: Gather Project Context

**Does the project have a repository?**

- **Yes →**
  1. Read `AGENTS.md` (stack, project type, structure)
  2. Read `README.md` (purpose)
  3. Look for existing NFR docs, SLAs, runbooks
  4. Detect what is already implemented (logging frameworks, monitoring, auth, rate limiting, health checks, etc.)
  5. Ask: *"Are there regulatory or compliance requirements that apply?"*

- **No →** *"Describe to me: project type (B2B, B2C, internal, regulated), industry, expected users, operational criticality"*

**In Contextual Mode:** Skip this step — use the context already established by the invoking skill.

## Full Mode — Interactive Cycle

### Phase 1: Classify the project

Guided questions (one at a time):
- What type of project is this? (B2B, B2C, internal, platform, regulated)
- What industry? (retail, finance, health, government, etc.)
- What is the operational criticality? (if it goes down, what happens?)
- How many users are expected? Are there traffic spikes?
- Are there regulations that apply? (PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, etc.)

**Output:** Clear project profile.

### Phase 2: Applicable categories

Based on the profile, present the relevant categories with their suggested priority:

| Category | What it covers | Typical relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Observability** | Logging, monitoring, alerting, tracing, dashboards | Always high |
| **Security** | AuthN, AuthZ, encryption, secret management, vulnerability scanning | Always high |
| **Data Privacy** | PII handling, data retention, consent, right to deletion | High if B2C or regulated |
| **Compliance** | Specific regulations, auditing, certifications | High if regulated |
| **Performance** | Latency, throughput, response time, capacity | High if user-facing |
| **Availability** | Uptime SLA, disaster recovery, failover, backup/restore | High if critical |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal/vertical scaling, capacity planning | Medium-high depending on volume |
| **Operations/Support** | Deployment, rollback, incident response, runbooks, on-call | Always medium-high |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG, screen readers, keyboard navigation | High if B2C web |

- Do not include categories that clearly do not apply to the context.
- The user can add or remove categories.

**Present and wait for approval.**

### Phase 3: Define per category

For each prioritized category (one at a time):
- Propose concrete metrics/criteria based on the project profile.
- Indicate what level of rigor is reasonable for the project type.
- Flag what already exists vs what is missing (if there is repo context).
- Concrete examples, not abstract definitions.

Example for Observability in a B2B:
- Structured logging (JSON) in all services
- Correlation ID propagated across services
- Health check endpoint on each service
- Business metrics dashboard (orders/hour, payment errors)
- Alerting configured for defined SLOs
- Distributed tracing across services

**Present NFRs per category and wait for approval before moving to the next one.**

### Phase 4: Prioritize timing

Classify each defined NFR as:

| Timing | Criterion | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Define now** | If not defined early, there is significant rework or operational risk | Structured logging (changing the format later requires migrating everything), AuthN/AuthZ (adding it later is a rewrite) |
| **Can wait** | Can be added later without architectural impact | Advanced dashboard, fine-grained alerting, accessibility improvements |

Present the complete matrix with justification for each classification.

**Present and wait for approval.**

### Phase 5: Generate design artifact

Compile into a structured artifact. Destination based on invocation context:

| Invoked from | Artifact | Who executes |
|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | Result returned to `brainstorming` to integrate into the design | `brainstorming` continues its flow (writes design doc, then calls `writing-plans`) |
| `docs-brainstorming` / `docs-system-orchestrator` | Documentation plan | `docs-assistant` |
| Standalone | Prioritized NFR document with timing matrix | `docs-assistant` |

---

## Contextual Mode — Targeted Intervention

| Invoker asks | What it does |
|---|---|
| "What NFRs should I consider for this project?" | Phases 1-2 quickly with provided context |
| "What NFRs can I not leave for later?" | Phase 4 only with already known NFRs |
| "Review whether I am missing anything in these NFRs" | Gap analysis against the project profile |
| "What level of observability do I need?" | One category from phase 3 only |

In contextual mode: do not open a full cycle, use the invoker's context, return result. Phase 5 does not apply — the invoker handles artifact generation.

---

## Cross-cutting Rules

- **Concrete over abstract.** "Structured JSON logging" is an NFR. "Having good observability" is not.
- **Timing is as important as the NFR.** Listing is not enough — you must say when.
- **Do not inflate the checklist.** Only NFRs that apply to the project profile. An internal project without sensitive data does not need GDPR.
- **One question at a time** in full mode.
- **Incremental approval** per phase.

---

## <TERMINATION_PHASE>

When the operating mode concludes, **STOP**.

1. Report the result (summary of defined NFRs and timing prioritization).
2. Indicate the next step according to the invocation context.
3. Wait for confirmation. Do not proceed automatically.
