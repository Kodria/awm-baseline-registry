## product 1.0.0 / dev 1.6.0 — 2026-07-22

### Added — bundle `product` (new)
- `product-process`: business-layer orchestrator (5 routes: discovery, brief, assessment, extraction, re-ingestion).
- `product-discovery`: problem framing + JTBD, problem-space only.
- `product-brief`: brief-spec methodology adopted into AWM; portable brief with frontmatter contract.
- `architecture-assessment`: scenario-based lightweight ATAM.
- `architecture-extraction`: arc42-lite + C4, optional Graphify layer with silent manual fallback.
- `readiness-gate`: G1–G9 Definition-of-Ready; seal is informative, gate is the authority.

### Changed — bundle `dev` 1.6.0
- `brainstorming` 1.2.0: Brief Preload Mode + solution-space precedence.
- `development-process` 1.3.0: brief-ready entry state + business-gap return rule.
- `using-awm` 1.2.0: two-orchestrator boundary, precedence and anti-loss rules.
